      <h3>Forks</h3>
      <p>
        We have detected forks in this project.
        Forks are caused by two or more dependencies requiring the same module with different versions.
        Forks have been known to cause issues so the recommendation is to get rid of these forks.
      </p>

      <p><b>Forks</b></p>
      <p>The following forks have been detected:</p>
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <td>Package</td>
            <td>Versions</td>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr repeat.for="fork of forks">
            <td>${fork.dep}</td>
            <td>${fork.versionString}</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><b>Recommendation</b></p>
      <p>
        "jspm update" sometimes resolves these forks.
        If this does not help, look in the config.js file for which packages depend on the above packages.
        Also, "jspm resolve only &lt;packagename&gt;" may help to resolve the fork.
